## DESCRIPTION 
  We will be using LeafletJS and the Library of Congress to display our information. While the modern map of the location will be displayed by Leaflet, historical maps of the location can be provided by the Library of Congress.



## USAGE 
Upon arrival to the index.html page "Map-Search", enter a valid city into the search form. When the search button is clicked, it will redirect a user to the results.html page, showing a current map and historical maps. The current map is interactive, and the historical maps include a "learn more" button that will redirect them to the Library of Congress webpage.
